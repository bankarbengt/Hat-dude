      <ul id="list">
        <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
        <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a
          Depression era program
          known as the "National Hat Administration"</li>
        <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps,
          helping starving
          Americans. "I couldn't afford the hats anymore", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
        <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Hat Service</li>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Headwear</li>
